## Plunk Hosted
If you are using Plunk's hosted service, you can make API requests to `https://api.useplunk.com`.

## Self-hosted
If you are self-hosting Plunk using the `driaug/plunk` Docker image, you can make API requests to the `/api` endpoint of your domain.

For example, if you are hosting Plunk at `https://plunk.example.com`, you make API requests to `https://plunk.example.com/api`.
