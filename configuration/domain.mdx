Sending emails from your own domain is a great way to build trust with your customers.

## Verifying your domain
When verifying your domain with Plunk, you choose a default sending address for your account. This is the address that we will use to send emails from your domain.

To verify your domain, you need to add 2 TXT and 3 CNAME records to your domain. You can find these records in the [project settings](https://app.useplunk.com/settings/identity).

By adding these records, you are giving Plunk permission to send emails from your domain, you can revoke this permission at any time by removing the records.

Plunk uses the industry standard [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) and [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) protocols to send emails from your domain. These protocols are used by email providers to verify that emails are sent from the correct domain.

## DMARC
DMARC is a way to configure what happens to emails when they fail SPF or DKIM checks. We recommend setting your DMARC policy to `quarantine` or `reject` to prevent spoofing of your domain.

- `quarantine` - Emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks will be sent to the spam folder.
- `reject` - Emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks will be rejected.

You can add a DMARC policy to your domain by adding a TXT record with the name `_dmarc` and the value `v=DMARC1; p=reject;`.

| Type | Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- | -----|
| `TXT` | `_dmarc` | `v=DMARC1; p=reject;` |

This example record will tell email providers to reject any emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks.
