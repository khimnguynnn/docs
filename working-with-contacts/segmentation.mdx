By using what we learned about [metadata](/working-with-contacts/metadata), we can now segment contacts into lists and groups.
This allows us to get better insights and target our contacts more effectively.

There are a few places where we can use metadata to segment contacts:

## Search
When searching for contacts on the dashboard, you can use metadata to filter contacts. In the query field, search for the key or value of the metadata you want to filter by.
All matching contacts will be shown in the results.

## Campaigns
When creating a campaign, toggle the `Advanced Selector` to use the events and metadata of contacts to segment them into lists.
