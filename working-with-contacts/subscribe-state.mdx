Contacts in Plunk are either subscribed or unsubscribed.

Depending on the status of a contact, they will receive or not receive emails from Plunk.

## Updating the subscription status of a contact
Giving contacts the ability to update their subscription status for marketing emails is a requirement in many countries, and is considered a best practice in others.

There are two ways to update the subscription status of a contact.

### Using Plunk-hosted pages
Each contact in Plunk has a set of three pages that can be used to update their subscription status.

<Tip>
    The URLs below are ready to use. Plunk will automatically fill in the ID for both actions and transactional emails.
</Tip>

- `https://app.useplunk.com/manage/{{plunk_id}}`, allows a contact to subscribe or unsubscribe depending on their current status.
- `https://app.useplunk.com/unsubscribe/{{plunk_id}}`, allows a contact to unsubscribe.
- `https://app.useplunk.com/subscribe/{{plunk_id}}`, allows a contact to subscribe.

### Using the Plunk API
With the ID of the contact, you can either [subscribe](/api-reference/contacts/subscribe) or [unsubscribe](/api-reference/contacts/unsubscribe) them.
