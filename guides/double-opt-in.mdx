Double opt-in is a great way to ensure that your contacts are interested in receiving your emails.

When you set up double opt-in, your contacts will receive an email asking them to confirm their subscription. Only after they confirm will they be added to the subscribed list.

## Creating an unsubscribed contact
We will start by creating a contact that is unsubscribed. You can do this by triggering an event and setting the `subscribed` property to `false`.

```javascript
await fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/track', {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer <API_KEY>"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        "event": "subscribed",
        "email": "hello@useplunk.com",
        "subscribed": false
    })
});
```

## Setting up a double opt-in template & action
Next, we will create a template and action that will be used to send the double opt-in email.

For the template there are two possible options:

- Use Plunk's subscription page, which is available for each contact at <Tooltip tip="plunk_id is an automatic variable, you can use it in templates without any configuration">`https://app.useplunk.com/subscribe/{{plunk_id}}`</Tooltip>
- Build your own subscription page and use the [contacts API](/api-reference/contacts/subscribe) to subscribe the contact.

After you have made your decision, create a **transactional template** and an action that triggers when the `subscribed` event is triggered.

<Warning>
    It is important to use a transactional template and not a marketing template. Marketing templates will not be sent to unsubscribed contacts.
</Warning>

## Triggering the double opt-in email
Now that everything is set up, you can integrate a trigger for your event into your landing page, blog, or wherever you collect emails.

Contacts will remain in an unsubscribed state until they click the link in the double opt-in email and confirm their subscription on the subscription page.
